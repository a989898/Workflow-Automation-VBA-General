# Workflow-Automation-VBA-General
Generalized VBA macros and programs for Workflow Automation
Developed & Designed by Kenneth Bauer 
----
This repository is a collection of higher level VBA program designs and my "go-to" subroutines that I have developed over the last few years to automate workflow. This repo is to be used as a baseline shell and further expanded on when put into context or adapted to your firm's specific task, workflow, or whatever process that is intented to be automated.

Most responsibilities and deliverables assigned to analysts in the finance industry fall into a familiar structure as follows: 

  Gather/Pull Data -> Clean/Format Data -> Load Data into DB -> Query Data from said DB -> Analyze Data + Laying Over Visuals -> Report/Publish Analysis
  
This process flow reflects ETL methedologies earlier in the chain, followed by analytical and reporting tasks towards the end. 
The programs here can be viewed as constituent pieces to the above deliverable chain that can be implemented to enhance efficiency/productivity.
Additional supplemental macros that are not necessarily core to the aforementioned process flow, yet helpful nonetheless, are also provided.
